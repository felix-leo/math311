# Newton's Interpolatory Divided Difference Formula -
#   This returns the coefficients of the interpolatory polynomial P
#   where f is stored in table form as A, which contains the
#     x-values and f(x-values) in the first and second columns
#   It will also evaluate the polynomial at a certain point.
